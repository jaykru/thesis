** Why you can't define the Nf or Ne presheaves on the syntactic category
*** They can't support a reasonable substitution action, since these presheaves are *not* closed under substitution
**** Why not?
The syntactic category is quotiented by definitional equality, so a faithful
action would need to send the morphisms \( [ \pi_1 (\texttt{true},
\texttt{false}) / x] \) and \( \texttt{true} / x \) to the same function
performing on terms the actual replacement for the variable $x$. In particular,
this forces that these two morphisms have the same action on
