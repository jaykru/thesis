	abstract = {This paper studies normalisation by evaluation for typed lambda calculus from a categorical and algebraic viewpoint. The ﬁrst part of the paper analyses the lambda deﬁnability result of Jung and Tiuryn via Kripke logical relations and shows how it can be adapted to unify deﬁnability and normalisation, yielding an extensional normalisation result. In the second part of the paper the analysis is reﬁned further by considering intensional Kripke relations (in the form of glueing) and shown to provide a function for normalising terms, casting normalisation by evaluation in the context of categorical glueing. The technical development includes an algebraic treatment of the syntax and semantics of the typed lambda calculus that allows the deﬁnition of the normalisation function to be given within a simply typed metatheory.},
