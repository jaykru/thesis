	abstract = {This paper studies normalisation by evaluation for typed lambda calculus from a categorical and algebraic viewpoint. The ﬁrst part of the paper analyses the lambda deﬁnability result of Jung and Tiuryn via Kripke logical relations and shows how it can be adapted to unify deﬁnability and normalisation, yielding an extensional normalisation result. In the second part of the paper the analysis is reﬁned further by considering intensional Kripke relations (in the form of glueing) and shown to provide a function for normalising terms, casting normalisation by evaluation in the context of categorical glueing. The technical development includes an algebraic treatment of the syntax and semantics of the typed lambda calculus that allows the deﬁnition of the normalisation function to be given within a simply typed metatheory.},

As corollaries we obtain both decidability of judgmental equality as well as the injectivity of type constructors in judgmentally consistent contexts.},

The advantage of this over earlier approaches by Plotkin and Statman is its simplicity and universality.

But if the variable set allowed in terms is also restricted to be nite then our techniques lead to a decision procedure.},
