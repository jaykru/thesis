	abstract = {We present new induction principles for the syntax of dependent type theories. These induction principles are expressed in the internal language of presheaf categories. This ensures for free that any construction is stable under substitution. In order to combine the internal languages of multiple presheaf categories, we use Dependent Right Adjoints and Multimodal Type Theory. Categorical gluing is used to prove these induction principles, but it not visible in their statements, which involve a notion of model without context extensions. We illustrate the derivation of these induction principles by the example of type theory with a hierarchy of universes closed under function space and natural numbers, but we expect that our method can be applied to any syntax with bindings. As example applications of these induction principles, we give short and boilerplate-free proofs of canonicity and normalization for our example type theory.},

	abstract = {We argue that locally Cartesian closed categories form a suitable doctrine for deﬁning dependent type theories, including non-extensional ones. Using the theory of sketches [KPT ], one may deﬁne syntactic categories for type theories in a style that resembles the use of Martin-Löf’s Logical Framework [NPS ], following the “judgments as types” principle [HHP ; Mar ]. The concentration of type theories into their locally Cartesian closed categories of judgments is particularly convenient for proving syntactic metatheorems by semantic means (canonicity, normalization, etc.). Perhaps surprisingly, the notion of a context plays no role in the deﬁnitions of type theories in this sense, but the structure of a class of display maps can be imposed on a theory post facto wherever needed, as advocated by the Edinburgh school and realized by the \%worlds declarations of the Twelf proof assistant [HHP ; PS ; HL ].},

	abstract = {Universal algebra uniformly captures various algebraic structures, by expressing them as equational theories or abstract clones. The ubiquity of algebraic structures in mathematics and related ﬁelds has given rise to several variants of universal algebra, such as theories of symmetric operads, non-symmetric operads, generalised operads, PROPs, PROs, and monads. These variants of universal algebra are called notions of algebraic theory. In this paper, we develop a uniﬁed framework for them. The key observation is that each notion of algebraic theory can be identiﬁed with a monoidal category, in such a way that algebraic theories correspond to monoid objects therein. To incorporate semantics, we introduce a categorical structure called metamodel, which formalises a deﬁnition of models of algebraic theories. We also deﬁne morphisms between notions of algebraic theory, which are a monoidal version of profunctors. Every strong monoidal functor gives rise to an adjoint pair of such morphisms, and provides a uniform method to establish isomorphisms between categories of models in diﬀerent notions of algebraic theory. A general structure-semantics adjointness result and a double categorical universal property of categories of models are also shown.},
