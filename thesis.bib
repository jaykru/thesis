	abstract = {This paper studies normalisation by evaluation for typed lambda calculus from a categorical and algebraic viewpoint. The ﬁrst part of the paper analyses the lambda deﬁnability result of Jung and Tiuryn via Kripke logical relations and shows how it can be adapted to unify deﬁnability and normalisation, yielding an extensional normalisation result. In the second part of the paper the analysis is reﬁned further by considering intensional Kripke relations (in the form of glueing) and shown to provide a function for normalising terms, casting normalisation by evaluation in the context of categorical glueing. The technical development includes an algebraic treatment of the syntax and semantics of the typed lambda calculus that allows the deﬁnition of the normalisation function to be given within a simply typed metatheory.},

	abstract = {Universal algebra uniformly captures various algebraic structures, by expressing them as equational theories or abstract clones. The ubiquity of algebraic structures in mathematics and related ﬁelds has given rise to several variants of universal algebra, such as theories of symmetric operads, non-symmetric operads, generalised operads, {PROPs}, {PROs}, and monads. These variants of universal algebra are called notions of algebraic theory. In this paper, we develop a uniﬁed framework for them. The key observation is that each notion of algebraic theory can be identiﬁed with a monoidal category, in such a way that algebraic theories correspond to monoid objects therein. To incorporate semantics, we introduce a categorical structure called metamodel, which formalises a deﬁnition of models of algebraic theories. We also deﬁne morphisms between notions of algebraic theory, which are a monoidal version of profunctors. Every strong monoidal functor gives rise to an adjoint pair of such morphisms, and provides a uniform method to establish isomorphisms between categories of models in diﬀerent notions of algebraic theory. A general structure-semantics adjointness result and a double categorical universal property of categories of models are also shown.},

The concentration of type theories into their locally Cartesian closed categories of judgments is particularly convenient for proving syntactic metatheorems by semantic means (canonicity, normalization, etc.). Perhaps surprisingly, the notion of a context plays no role in the deﬁnitions of type theories in this sense, but the structure of a class of display maps can be imposed on a theory post facto wherever needed, as advocated by the Edinburgh school and realized by the \%worlds declarations of the Twelf proof assistant [{HHP} ; {PS} ; {HL} ].},
