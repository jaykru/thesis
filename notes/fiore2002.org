* The category of renamings
** The category \mathbb{F}
The category of untyped contexts \mathbb{F} has:
- As objects, finite subsets of (the countably infinite set of) variables; and
- as morphisms, all functions on finite variable subsets.
** The comma construction (from Riehl)
For functors F : D -> C , G: E -> C
The comma category F \downarrow G has
- As objects, triples (d\in D, e\in E, f : Fd \rightarrow Ge \in C); and
- As morphisms, \( (d,e,f) \rightarrow (d',e',f') \), a morphism \( (h : d
  \rightarrow d', k: e\rightarrow e') \) in the product category \( D \times E
  \) such that \( f' \circ Fh = Gk \circ f \).
